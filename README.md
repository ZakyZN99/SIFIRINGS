# SIFIRINGS
SIFIRINGS is a system for tracking the location of ships where each ship will be paired with a device to send the location of the ship connected to the arduino. The device will send ship location data to the gateway at the station. Communication between these devices uses lora to send data. The device at the station contains Lora and Raspberry Pi.
